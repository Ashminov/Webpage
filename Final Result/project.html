            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Dimitrov was born in Haskovo, Bulgaria to Dimitar,
                a tennis coach, and mother Maria, a sports teacher and former volleyball player, in
                1991. He first held a tennis racket, given to him by his mother, at the age of
                three, and when he was five he began to play daily. In his early years
                his father served as his coach, but after the young Bulgarian proved his talent in the tournaments for juniors
                , he made it clear that he would have to develop in other conditions. At the age of 16, Dimitrov turned professional.</p>

                <h2>Personal Life</h2>
                <p>Dimitrov began dating Maria Sharapova in late 2012.
                    He and Sharapova only confirmed their relationship after the 2013 Madrid Open where the Bulgarian managed his first win
                    against a world No. 1, beating Novak Djokovic. Sharapova and Dimitrov separated in July 2015. At the beginning of 2016,
                    he started discreetly dating American singer Nicole Scherzinger, the lead vocalist of The Pussycat Dolls. After a triumphant win at the
                    2017 ATP Finals, Dimitrov praised Scherzinger, in a rare display of public affection, as deserving "a lot of credit for these last two weeks".
                    He dedicated his recent success and victory to her "She has been great. These two weeks have been some of the best ever".</p>

            <h2>National representation</h2>
            <h3 style="text-align:left">Davis Cup</h3>
            <p> Dimitrov made his Davis Cup debut for Bulgaria in 2008 as a 16-year-old.
                Playing in front of a home crowd in Plovdiv, the teenage Dimitrov compiled an undefeated record
                in both singles and doubles to promote his country into the second division of the Europe/Africa zone.
                A 17-year-old Dimitrov returned to the Bulgarian Davis Cup team for the first round of the Davis Cup Europe/Africa zone in 2009.
                Dimitrov was victorious in both his singles rubbers which led to a narrow 3-2 victory over Hungary. He would then take a few breaks
                from Davis Cup which would result in Bulgaria being relegated back to the lowest division of Davis Cup.
                Dimitrov would return to Davis Cup competition in 2012 as a top 100 player. The
                Bulgarians breezed through the round robin tournament held in their home city of Sofia and would once again be promoted
                to the second division of the Europe/Africa zone. Dimitrov and the Bulgarian Davis Cup team have been unable to advance past
                the first round since being promoted but have been victorious in their two relegation ties.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align:left">Olympics</h3>
            <p>Dimitrov represented Bulgaria at his maiden Olympics in London 2012.
                He competed in the singles competition and advanced past the first round with a straight sets victory over
                Poland's Łukasz Kubot. He was then beaten by France's 12th seed Gilles Simon. Dimitrov made his second
                Olympic appearce in 2016 Rio where he was beaten in the first round of the singles competition by
                Croatian Marin Čilić.</p>
